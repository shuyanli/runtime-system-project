# runtime-system-project
This is the repo for the long term project for runtime system course
==============================================================================================================================

We would like to develope and evaluate the performance of the GO programming language.  This is the initial, naive, first draft of our milestone of the project.

1. learn quickly how to program in go, since we are both not familier with this novel language.
2. follow the instrutions and materials in https://blog.golang.org/profiling-go-programs and recreate the experiments for 5 go programs to optimize the program. 
3. try and test StackImpect. find more programs and use different input to test the program. Analyse the output after testing the program.
4. Generates more results with more programs and more inputs
5. try reimplement the go playground with broswer. In other words, using JS and go to reimplement it.

Further goals need to be determined after finishing the previous steps. Might need to discuss with the instructor for help.
