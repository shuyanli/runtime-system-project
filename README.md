# runtime-system-project

This is the repo for the long term project for runtime system course


## Project description:

We would like to develope and evaluate the performance of the GO programming language.  This is the initial, naive, first draft of our milestone of the project.

1. learn quickly how to program in go, since we are both not familier with this novel language.
2. follow the instrutions and materials in https://blog.golang.org/profiling-go-programs and recreate the experiments for 5 go programs to optimize the program. 
3. try and test StackImpect. find more programs and use different input to test the program. Analyse the output after testing the program.
4. Generates more results with more programs and more inputs
5. try reimplement the go playground with broswer. In other words, using JS and go to reimplement it.

Further goals need to be determined after finishing the previous steps. Might need to discuss with the instructor for help.



## Assignment for this week:

1. Learn go language and try some small fun programs.

2. Think about the future goals of the long term project



## Assignment for the future: (to be modified)

1. Try implement the process 2 though 4 in README. 
2. Discuss with the professor if we met some big problems or confusions.
