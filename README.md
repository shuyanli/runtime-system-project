## Project description:

We would like to develope and evaluate the performance of the GO programming language.  This is the initial, naive, first draft of our milestone of the project.

1. learn quickly how to program in go, since we are both not familier with this novel language.
2. follow the instrutions and materials in https://blog.golang.org/profiling-go-programs and recreate the experiments for more go programs to optimize the program. 
3. try and test StackImpect. See how it helps go profiling



Further goals need to be determined after finishing the previous steps. Might need to discuss with the instructor for help.
